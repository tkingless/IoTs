# Prototyping a Remote controlled robot

## Keys
1. Events: robotic behaviors
2. Communications: BLE, UART
3. Operations and Env: process, boot-config
4. Other hardware scripts: AppInventor, microbits

##Usage
1. source the UART venv
2. sudo pigpiod
3. create /tmp/Robot/ folder
4. python Robot.py start
5. python Robot.py stop

##Installation from fresh OS

1. Set Englsih Lang, password, username and etc.


2. Install bluez 5.48: http://www.bluez.org/download/
3. Install dependencies: sudo apt-get install -y libusb-dev libdbus-1-dev libglib2.0-dev libudev-dev libical-dev libreadline-dev
4. Turn the bluetooth service's BLE feature: sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/bluetooth.service, enable --experimental feature

5. Setup Github environment
6. Download source code


##Android BLE central to RPi peripheral cycle:
